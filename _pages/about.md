title: About UV Software
---
UV&nbsp;Software was founded in 2002 as a solo self-employed company.
As an independent software developer, I provide services in all areas related to industrial communication, motion control, and automation.
I specialize in microcontroller programming and field bus systems, in particular the CAN bus and CANopen protocol.
My services can be rendered on site or from my office in Berlin, in the form of a work order or a service agreement.
See my [blog](https://uv-software.com/wordpress/category/projects/) for the things I did.

## Memberships
Since 2007 UV&nbsp;Software is a member of the international CAN users’ and manufacturers’ group [CAN&nbsp;in&nbsp;Automation](https://www.can-cia.org/) (CiA).

## Sponsoring
These projects are developed and maintained in my leisure time.
If you like them (all of them, or just one) I would be very happy if you make a donation to my work.
