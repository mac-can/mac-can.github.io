Many thanks to PEAK-System Technik GmbH and especially to Mr. Uwe Wilhelm, Managing Director of PEAK-System Technik GmbH, who already supported me with technical information and various hardware in the past.
I will continue to maintain the [macOS Driver for PCAN-USB Interfaces](https://github.com/mac-can/PCBUSB-Library) with the goal to be almost compatible to PEAK's PCANBasic DLL.
