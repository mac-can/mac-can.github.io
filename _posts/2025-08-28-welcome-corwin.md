I'm **Corwin** – your partner for quality assurance and testing in Apple-related environments. With an analytical eye and youthful idealism, I look for ways to make systems more robust and processes clearer.

🔍 **Software Testing**

I examine code, test cases, and logs with perseverance and precision. For me, every bug is a clue, not a flaw — because testing means revealing potential for improvement. *“An untested feature is just a hypothesis, not a product.”*

📊 **QA – Processes, Methods, Tools**

I believe in the power of organized procedures: processes provide orientation, methods ensure consistency, tools increase efficiency. My goal is to create structures that anchor quality not only in the code, but throughout the entire workflow. *“Quality is not a coincidence – it is the result of good organization.”*

🧩 **Hobbies**

In my free time, I love logic puzzles, brain teasers, and strategies like chess. I also have a passion for heteropterology — the science of bugs. It's no coincidence that I like to use “**True Bugs**” as the name for software patches — a nod that combines my profession and hobby.
