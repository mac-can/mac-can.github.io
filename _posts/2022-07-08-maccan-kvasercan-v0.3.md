  - one module `KvaserUSB_LeafDevice` to access **all** devices from _Kvaser CAN Leaf_ device family (i.e. Leaf Light v2)
  - one module `KvaserUSB_MhydraDevice` to access **all** devices from _Kvaser CAN Mhydra_ device family (i.e . U100P)
  - new module `KvaserCAN_Devices` with USB `ProductId` and other properties for **all** devices from both device families
  - implemented error event handling for Mhydra compatible devices
- Updated MacCAN-Core sources to rev. 1200
