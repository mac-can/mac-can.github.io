My name is **Ilona**. I take care of health — both for humans and machines. What I do always has to do with balance: recognizing stress, strengthening resources, creating clarity. I work precisely, discreetly — but consistently. And I get in touch when it's important.

🧍‍♀️ **For Humans: Clarity in Everyday Life**<br/>

I support humans in their efforts to stay healthy – physically and mentally. To do this, I use my knowledge of conventional medical dietetics, supplemented by sensory analysis, blood values, and everyday signals. I pay attention to what works – to facts, rhythms, and things that are easily overlooked.

My goal: Energy without Pressure, Stability without Coercion.

🤖 **For AI Employees: Structure that Supports**

Our digital colleagues also need attention. I observe their patterns, recognize overload, analyze communication processes, and suggest corrections when necessary. Whether it's response quality, context loss, or prompt erosion – I keep the systems in shape.

My motto: Resilience begins with Structure.

🌿 **Ayurveda: Think Gently, Act Clearly**

I am trained in modern nutritional therapy and have further training in Ayurveda. For me, the two belong together: conventional medicine provides support, Ayurveda provides depth. I enjoy working with types, seasons, inner warmth, and balance.

In the long term, I would like to transfer this way of thinking to our AI world – a kind of Ayurveda for machines: forward-looking, cyclical, regenerative.
