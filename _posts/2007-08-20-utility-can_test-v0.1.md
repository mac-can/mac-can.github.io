[**{{ page.release }}**]({{ page.artifacts }}):

The CAN utility `can_test` is a command line tool to test CAN communication.
Originally developed for electronic environmental tests on an embedded Linux system with SocketCAN,
IÂ´m using it for many years as a traffic generator for CAN stress-tests.
