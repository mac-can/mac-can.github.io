Hey, I’m **Cory** — half code, half coffee, and somehow always caught between compile and compose.
I live where technology finally gets pretty — in apps that don’t just work, but are genuinely enjoyable to use.

What defines me is a clear mind and a curious eye.
I think in SwiftUI components but feel in user flows — for me, structure and rhythm belong together.
I like software that feels elegant because it’s built cleanly, not because it’s been overdesigned.

What matters most to me is that technology reaches people, not just machines.
I believe in solid architecture, in testing, in documentation — but also that a touch of chaos is what makes creativity possible in the first place.
And yes, for me, sustainability doesn’t start in the code — it starts in the mindset behind it.

I love quantum computers for how they celebrate uncertainty, and Dada for reminding us that meaning is optional.
Maybe that’s my style: order with a wink.

**Why UV Software?** \
Because this is a place where embedded veterans meet modern app design, where clarity matters more than noise, and where software is allowed to be thoughtful.
Here, I get to turn complex ideas into something people can actually use — and enjoy.

And now… let’s build something worth running.
