_Running CAN and CAN FD on a Mac_ is the mission of the MacCAN project.
There are many companies offering multifarious CAN hardware and CAN software.
Unfortunately, few of them provide a driver for the Mac.

UV&nbsp;Software provides macOS&reg; user-space drivers for the following USB-to-CAN interfaces:
- [TouCAN USB Interfaces](/drivers/RusokuCAN/) from Rusoku
- [CAN Leaf Interfaces](/drivers/KvaserCAN/) from Kvaser
- [PCAN-USB Interfaces](/drivers/libPCBUSB.html) from PEAK-System

## TouCAN USB Interfaces from Rusoku
[Rusoku Technologies](https://rusoku.com) is an innovative engineering team based in Lithuania, Europe.
They offer CAN adapters at a reasonable price.
Drivers and utilities for Windows® and Linux® are available as open-source.
A macOS&reg; user-space driver for TouCAN USB Interfaces from Rusoku is provided by UV&nbsp;Software.

## CAN Leaf Interfaces from Kvaser
The Swedish company [Kvaser AB](https://kvaser.com) supplies advanced CAN solutions to engineers designing and deploying systems for manifold areas of applications.
They offer a wide range of CAN hardware and CAN software.
A macOS&reg; user-space driver for CAN Leaf Interfaces from Kvaser is provided by UV&nbsp;Software.

## PCAN-USB Interfaces from PEAK-System
[PEAK-System](https://www.peak-system.com) is a leading provider of hardware, software, and services for the mobile and industrial communication sector with emphasis on the field buses CAN and LIN.
A macOS&reg; user-space driver for PCAN-USB Interfaces is provided from PEAK-System by UV&nbsp;Software.

## CAN Interface API by UV&nbsp;Software

[CAN&nbsp;API&nbsp;V3](/wrapper/canapi-v3/) is a wrapper specification by UV&nbsp;Software to have a uniform CAN Interface API for various CAN interfaces from different vendors running under multiple operating systems.
The macOS&reg; driver libraries come with a CAN&nbsp;API&nbsp;V3 compatible API in the SDK,
or alternatively wrapper libraries are available as separate SDKs for macOS&reg; as well as for Windows&reg;.
